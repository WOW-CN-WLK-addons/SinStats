SinLive™ stats are dynamic stats that react to your current target. These stats will scale, and their values will be updated based on the target level and the debuffs that are applied.

If your target is affected by Hunter’s Mark and Winter’s Chill, your Attack Power and Spell Crit stats will be affected accordingly. Click on any stat on the Settings Panel to get more info. SinLive™ stats will be indicated in the description below stats.

Most stats are highly configurable with the Extended Options, allowing you to display your stats in many different ways with the most precision.

A number of abilities, talents, enchants, consumables, tier set bonuses, racials, procs, buffs and world buffs have been manually added and used to provide an unmatched accuracy. The HUD was designed to reflect your actual numbers in real-time, as they are at any moment during combat (or outside of combat!). If you use all your cooldowns on a boss fight, your stats will reflect the improved numbers! Some of these stats will even scale based on your target level!
